# Crest Discount Tracker Icon Instructions

## Icon Requirements
- File name: Icon.blp or Icon.tga
- Recommended size: 64x64 pixels (square)
- Location: Place in the root folder of your addon (same directory as the .toc file)

## Suggested Icon Design
Create an icon that represents the addon's purpose - tracking item levels for crest discounts:

1. **Background**: A dark gold/bronze circular background resembling a crest or coin
2. **Main Element**: A stylized gear or equipment piece in the center
3. **Accent**: A small upward-pointing arrow or chart line in bright green to represent "tracking" or "improvement"
4. **Optional**: Small number indicators (like "636+") to represent the tier thresholds

## Creating the Icon
You can create this icon using any image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or even online tools like Canva.

1. Create a new 64x64 pixel document
2. Design the icon following the suggestions above
3. Save as .tga format (preferred) or convert to .blp using a BLP converter tool
4. Name the file "Icon.blp" or "Icon.tga"
5. Place in your addon's root directory

## Adding Icon Reference to TOC File
After creating the icon, add this line to your CrestDiscountTracker.toc file:

```
## IconTexture: Interface\AddOns\CrestDiscountTracker\Icon.blp
```

Or if using .tga format:

```
## IconTexture: Interface\AddOns\CrestDiscountTracker\Icon.tga
```

This will ensure the icon appears in the WoW addon list.
