- Identify which gear slots need upgrading to reach the next tier
- Track the highest item level you've had in each slot (even if not currently equipped)
- Visualize your progress toward the next discount tier

## Discount Tiers

The addon tracks your eligibility for these Warband Crest discount tiers:

| Tier | Name | Required Item Level | Discount |
|------|------|---------------------|----------|
| 1 | Gilded of the Undermine | 675+ | 33% |
| 2 | Runed of the Undermine | 662+ | 33% |
| 3 | Carved of the Undermine | 649+ | 33% |
| 4 | Weathered of the Undermine | 636+ | 33% |
